## Lyrics


```
I knew I can't relate yooo
skra aye, shh shh, try to shut it out
stuck it up at the fucking rasta 
(hide it ayayayayaya, stuck it up aye)

fucking rasta aye 
fucking afta' right (all/lead the way)

focal point of all the dissing's 
not too bold "fuck it up" 
don't (to) look it up

fucking rasta
fucking 'nother rasta ey ya

don't you listen 
to the established order blood
sudden - betrayal 
of the honoured folks

stuck like a bru aye a bad exp 
x x x
to lick the top of the crux

x quick

Last part of the song:

rasta, taste that about the rest
another believer that cares for a reason
take it or leave it - ooo
fucking it up

this is the season, for bliss apparition
(coz it's) never a treason to reflect at the deeds

smoke at the fact of great intuition
to grow your soul's blight in the garden of seeds

```
