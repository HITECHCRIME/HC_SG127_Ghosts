## Lyrics

```
I knew I can't relate yooo skra aye
try to shut it out
stuck it up at the fucking rasta
fucking rasta aye 
fucking afta right (all/lead the way)

rasta, taste that about the rest
another believer that cares for a reason
take it or leave it - ooo
fucking it up

this is the season, for bliss apparition
never a treason to reflect at the deeds
smoke at the fact of great intuition
to grow your soul's blight in the garden of seeds

```
