## Lyrics

```
I knew I can't relate yooo aye
(try to shut it out)
not all the fucking rasta
(all/lead the way)

rasta, taste that about the rest
another believer that cares for a reason
take it or leave it
of fucking it up

this is the season, for bliss apparition
never a treason to reflect at the deeds
smoke at the fact of great intuition
to grow your blight soul in the garden of seeds




```
